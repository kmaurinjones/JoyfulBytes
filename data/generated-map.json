The show features three one-act plays penned by **President Michael Duclos**, seamlessly weaving together stories that highlight the true spirit of Christmas.\n\n**Duclos**, who founded the theatre earlier this year, is committed to providing affordable performing arts opportunities for youth in Sault Ste. Marie. Drawing from his 14 years of teaching experience in the Northwest Territories, he understands the importance of creative outlets for young people.\n\nRehearsals are in full swing, with the group focusing on character development to bring depth to the intertwining narratives of _The Snow Globe_, _Christmas Presence_, and _Beth Laham_. Duclos aims to deliver a heartwarming experience that emphasizes the value of believing in the Christmas spirit and cherishing time with loved ones over material possessions.\n\nNow a parent, Duclos is excited to involve his own children in the production, fostering a love for theatre in the next generation. **_Just Claus_** promises to be a memorable holiday event, inviting families to celebrate togetherness and the magic of the season. Tickets are available online or at the Station Mall kiosk, encouraging community support for the young actors' creative efforts.",
